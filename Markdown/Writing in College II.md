# Co-working with AI
How to "communicate" with a Chatbot?
Useful prompts
## Writing Effective Prompts 1
**What is prompt?**
- Blunt version: A prompt can be the information, sentences, or questions that you enter a Generative Al tool.
- More precise definition: prompt refers to the instructions in natural language (either written or spoken) a user give to artificial intelligence.
*simple keywords, questions, structured instructions, code snippet, or even writing samples.*
## Writing Effective Prompts 2
**What is the purpose of a prompt?**
- to communicate a task or request to an Al system clearly and effectively.
- A well-crafted prompt helps the Al understand the user's intent, define the context, and generate relevant, accurate, and useful output.
In short, a prompt is *how you tell the Al what you want*.


## Writing Effective Prompts 3
- In the context of using Al (like DeepSeek, FutureGene, ChatGPT, Grok, or other generative tools), **the user writes the prompt**. This could be a student, researcher, designer, developer, or anyone interacting with the Al tool.
- **The Al system reads the prompt**. It analyzes the input and generates a response based on its training and the context you've provided.
